HiFive1 SDK projects for building with Embecosm RISC-V toolchain
================================================================

This repository contains some HiFive1 SDK examples, modified such that they can
be built with the Embecosm RISC-V toolchain. Presently only the `led_fade` demo
is ported.

To build `led_fade`, run `make` in the `led_fade` subdirectory (assuming that
the Embecosm RISC-V toolchain is on the path).
